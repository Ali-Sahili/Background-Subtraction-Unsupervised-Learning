# The Pixel-Based Adaptive Segmenter

### Requirements:
* opencv-3.0
* python-3.5
* numpy


### Algorithm steps:			
 1- Read a Video
 2- Apply gaussian Filter
 3- Split each frame into 3 channels
 4- Initilize the model with zeros or using a simple background substraction algorithm
 5- Excute algorithm for each channel in parallel
 6- Apply bitwise_or between 3 outputs or bitwise_and between 3 outputs
 7- repeat until end of this video

## Testing
to run the code in c++, put into your terminal:

g++ -ggdb main.cpp PBAS.cpp PixelBasedAdaptiveSegmenter.cpp -o main `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`

to run the code in python put into your terminal:

python3 PBAS.py
